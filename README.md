## Project Description
For the past few months, I have been looking for a new job, ideally a remote job for a company in the EMEA area. I have spent hours searching LinkedIn, CareerVault, AngelList, and more. These are all great sites; however, many times remote-first companies do not post their jobs on these site. This means I have spent hours going to individual companies' websites, checking their job openings, and applying to those positions for which I qualify. 

After opening these webpages over and over to check for new job postings, I realised that this was the perfect opportunity to automate. 

## Personal Goals
**Overall Project Goal**: Reduce the amount of work spent doing repetitive tasks while applying to jobs in order to spend more time working on personal projects, continuing education, and writing quality cover letters. 

**Learning Goals**:
1. Develop a strong understanding of classes in Python
2. Create my own scheduled ETL pipeline
3. Use NLP libraries and extract features from text
4. Use Django to create web app

## Workflow
**Completed**
- scrape blogs to gather a workable list of remote-first companies
- classify each website based on hr platform used
- develop mvp for scraping each different hr platform

**In Progress**
- using classes, develop ETL for scraping different hr platforms
- automate daily scraping of these sites

**Up Next**
- write code for scraping remaining websites that do not use common hr platforms
- create user interface for basic information

**Future**
- scrape job descriptions and extract NLP features
- allow filtering and searching of these features in web app
